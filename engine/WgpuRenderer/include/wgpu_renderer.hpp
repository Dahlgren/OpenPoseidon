/*
 * wgpu_renderer.hpp — C++ interface to the WGPU graphics backend.
 *
 * While this file contains C++ features, the actual exported symbols are all C ABI (extern "C"),
 * which the Rust side can implement using #[no_mangle] and #[repr(C)].
 *
 * THREADING CONTRACT: every function in this header forms an exclusive reference to
 * the renderer (except the wgr_uploader_* borrow, documented at its declaration), and
 * the Rust side spawns no threads of its own and guards nothing against concurrent
 * entry. So the rule is ONE THREAD AT A TIME, IN FRAME ORDER -- not "main thread
 * only": with the render thread on (WGR_RENDER_THREAD, default), wgr_render_frame and
 * the queued resource/instance/settings drains run on the worker, and the producer
 * may call in only while the worker holds no frame. EngineWgpu enforces that window
 * (WaitRenderIdle at InitDraw, closed at publish; REN-THR-012) and exposes it as
 * ProducerMayTouchRenderer(), which the texture paths check. Texture destruction is
 * immediate (no epoch -- see gfx3d/pool.rs for the one resource class that HAS one),
 * which stays safe only because of that ordering. Phase 4.2 of the post-DLSS roadmap
 * makes the Rust side check it too (design notes, row 3.10).

       follows slightly, because a sky filling with cirrus really does thicken as it fills. This
       is the quantity control that wgr_set_cirrus_mode's on/off was not.

       `matchDeck` 0 = high ice cloud (the layer as it has always been) .. 1 = as close to the
       CUMULUS DECK below as a shell march gets: the shell descends to just above the deck's top,
       feature size follows the deck's own shape scale, the shear stretch and fibre striation
       relax to isotropic cells, the shell deepens, optical depth rises, the ice halo phase gives
       way to the deck's, and a cheap vertical self-shading term appears so the result reads as
       solid cloud rather than glowing fog. Every target is read from the deck's LIVE parameters,
       so "similar" tracks whatever the weather is doing; the layer is clamped so it can never
       sink into or below the deck, because then it would stop being a second layer.

       Both clamp to 0..1 and both are eased by the renderer (matchDeck moves the layer's altitude
       by kilometres, so an un-eased drag would teleport a cloud deck across the sky). Same

       within a short distance of its boundary and has a definite silhouette. 1 = density is held
       down through a much wider band either side of that threshold, so the transmittance falls off
       over a longer path and the cloud gains a deep, soft fringe. High cloud is ice, and its edges
       sublimate rather than condense, so a fringe is what it should have.

       WEIGHTED BY LOCAL COVERAGE, so it reaches the big merged banks and leaves isolated wisps
       defined. The layer's mean density is restored as the exponent rises, so this stays a shape
       control and does not double as a brightness one.

       terrain grid stops, where Scene::GetObjectDrawDistance puts the object cull ring, and where
       the map itself ends -- so anything still visible there reads as the world being cut off.
       Lower values move full fog inward, so everything from there out is uniformly the sky's own
       airlight and there is no edge left to see.

       NOT the same control as the fog falloff exponent in WgrSkyLook: that shapes how fast the
       ramp climbs, so lowering it to thicken the far field also thickens the near and mid field.

       rebuilt every frame: the CLD-020 cloud sun-transmittance map (so a cloud bank crossing the
       sun reshapes the shafts — the point of the feature), the long-range terrain shadow-ceiling
       mask, and the cascade shadow map (buildings, tree crowns). No new geometry or shadow pass.

       Consequences of being world-space rather than screen-space, both of which are requirements
       and not accidents: the sun's SCREEN position never enters the shader, so an off-screen sun
       produces no edge halo; and the fade-out below the horizon / behind the camera comes from the
       sun-elevation ramp and the forward-peaked phase function rather than a special case.

       `density` = scattering coefficient, 1/m (the engine's clear-day Mie is 6e-6).
       `distance` = march cap, metres. `g` = Henyey-Greenstein anisotropy (higher = tighter beam).
       `cloudInfluence` = how strongly the deck shapes the shafts; 0 = geometry only, for A/B.
       `steps` and `resDiv` are the cost knobs — `resDiv` is the screen-resolution divisor for the
       march target (2 = half in each axis, the default). Everything clamps.
