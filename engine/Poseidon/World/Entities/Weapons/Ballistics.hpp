// Drag-correct ballistic prediction.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Our projectiles fly with air drag -- `ShotShell::Simulate`
// (World/Entities/Weapons/Shots.cpp:684) integrates
//
//     accel  = speed * (|speed| * _airFriction)
//     accel.y -= _coefGravity * G_CONST
//
// but every AI aiming site predicts where that projectile will go with a DRAG-FREE closed form.
// The canonical instance is Man::GetAimTargetPosition (World/Entities/Infantry/SoldierOldAI.cpp:446):
//
//     float time     = distance * _invInitSpeed;
//     float fallPerM = time * _invInitSpeed * 0.5f * G_CONST;
//
// -- a vacuum parabola. The same two lines are repeated at SoldierOldAI.cpp:357 and :1259,
// AI/VehicleAICombat.cpp:1417, Air/AirplaneAI.cpp:282, Air/HelicopterAI.cpp:303, Ground/Car.cpp:2168,
// Ground/Motorcycle.cpp:2184, Ground/TankWithAI.cpp:260 and Misc/Ship.cpp:1746. So the AI aims with
// a model that is not the model the bullet flies under, and the disagreement grows with range and
// with airFriction. That is a correctness gap, not a difficulty setting.
//
// This closes it by integrating the shot rather than solving a parabola. The integrator is not an
// approximation of our flight model -- it is the SAME forward-Euler scheme, step for step:
// acceleration from the old speed, position advanced with the old speed, speed updated afterwards,
// launch delay gating both. Reproducing our own simulation is exactly what a predictor has to do.
//
// TWO POINTS WHERE THE OBVIOUS TRANSCRIPTION WOULD BE WRONG for this engine:
//
//  * Spending a whole step decrementing `initTime` without moving is the natural reading of a
//    launch delay. Ours decrements `_initDelay` and, in the same frame, moves if it has gone
//    non-positive (Shots.cpp:686-703). Doing it the other way would put the prediction one step
//    of flight behind the projectile.
//  * Our drag reads `ShotAirspeed(_speed)`, which folds in wind when the ballistics-wind opt-in is
//    on. The predictor deliberately does NOT model wind: an aiming solution cannot know the wind
//    the round will meet along a path it has not flown, and pretending otherwise would make the AI
//    hit better than a human can. With the opt-in off -- the shipping default -- `ShotAirspeed` is
//    the identity and prediction and flight agree exactly.
//
// The unguided-rocket half is ported too and lives further down (`SimulateUnguidedMissile*`,
// `CompensateUnguidedMissile`). It is a genuinely different model, not a variation -- see the
// comment above MissileParams for why a rocket droops less than a shell of the same speed.

// UNGUIDED ROCKETS
//
// A rocket is not a shell with a bigger number. `Missile::Simulate` gives it a launch delay, a
// thrust phase along its OWN forward axis, and an anisotropic body drag with cubic terms that
// differ by axis -- sideways motion is punished an order of magnitude harder than forward motion,
// which is what keeps a fin-stabilised rocket pointing where it was fired. Gravity therefore does
// not simply bend the path: it is resisted by that side drag, so a rocket droops far less than a
// shell of the same speed, and a shell solver applied to one is wrong in the direction that
// matters (it would over-elevate).
//
// WHAT THIS IS A SIMPLIFICATION OF, stated so nobody mistakes it for the full model. The engine
// flies a missile as a RIGID BODY: `Missile::Simulate` also builds torque, lets aerodynamic
// forces rotate the body toward its velocity, and for a guided missile steers it at a target.
// This predictor holds the orientation FIXED at the launch attitude and integrates the point
// mass. That is exactly right for the question an aiming solver asks -- "along which line do I
// launch an unguided rocket so it arrives" -- and it is exactly wrong for a guided missile, whose
// flight is decided by its steering, not by its launch direction. Guided weapons must not use it.
