// Solid meshes for the physics probes.
//
// The wireframe view shows where a body is; a solid one shows what it looks like
// resting against something, which is the thing you actually want to judge when a
// domino row half-falls or a crate lands on a slope.
//
// Every mesh is built at UNIT SIZE once and scaled per instance through the
// object's orientation matrix -- an Object has no scale of its own, but the
// orientation is three column vectors and scaling them scales the model. So one
// box mesh serves every box, whatever its dimensions.

/// check is judging. Applies to every already-built mesh, so it takes effect on the
